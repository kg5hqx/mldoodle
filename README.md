This jupyter notebook evaluates the effectiveness of travel coupons among drivers based on various driver profile and travel arrangements. This exercise examined bar coupons, followed by a quick evaluation of all coupons and finally took a deeper look at the Carry away coupon offering.
# Summary of Findings
Bar coupons: The analysis found that the bar coupons had the highest rate of utilization among drivers that travel alone.
Carry Away coupons: The analysis found that the most accepted coupon is the Carry Away coupon.  Among the Carry-away coupon users, the target audience can be improved by offering the coupons to occupations with the highest acceptance rates.
